GPU-Accelerated LIBSVM is exploiting the GPU, using the CUDA interface, to
speed-up the training process. This package contains a new executable for 
training classifiers "svm-train-gpu.exe" together with the original one.
The use of the new executable is exactly the same as with the original one.


FEATURES

Mode Supported

    * c-svc classification with RBF kernel

Functionality / User interface

    * Same as LIBSVM


PREREQUISITES

    * NVIDIA Graphics card with CUDA support
    * Latest NVIDIA drivers for GPU
	* CUDA toolkit
	* GPU Computing SDK code samples (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_downloads.html (January 2011))
	

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy this folder to "/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/C/src"

2. Use the Makefile found in "/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/"

3. Find the "svm-train-gpu" executable in /NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/C/bin/linux/release


Troubleshooting

1.You may need some additional packets to be installed in order to complete the installations above. 
Please refer to the web for more details according to error messages you get.


2.The following error "error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
can be resolved with:

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
